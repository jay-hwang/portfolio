      <p>
        It was one of my childhood dreams to know how to code. I was always so fascinated by technology. Being able to create virtually anything you can imagine by typing a set of symbols and characters into a computer. Blows my mind away. My coding journey began when I stumbled across an iOS coding tutorial website. It was love at first sight. I was hooked.
        <br/><br/>
        I went from being able to write simple 'for loops', to building and deploying multiple full-stack web applications in a matter of months. I have an obsession to understand how things work under the hood. I thoroughly enjoy having my mind challenged and solving engineering problems that push me past my comfort zone. I love exploring the unknown, especially with fearless, ambitious people that strive to move the world forward.

        You can usually find me drumming away or cruising around the city on two wheels when I need to unwind. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or leave a message!
