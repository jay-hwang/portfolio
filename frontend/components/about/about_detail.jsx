      <p>
        My journey as an engineer began a little less than a year ago, when I stumbled across an iOS coding tutorial website. It was love at first sight.
        <br/><br/>
        I went from being able to write simple 'for loops', to building and deploying multiple full-stack web applications in a matter of months. I have an obsession to understand how things work under the hood. I thoroughly enjoy having my mind challenged and solving engineering problems that push me past my comfort zone. I love exploring the unknown, especially with fearless, ambitious people that strive to move the world forward.
        <br/><br/>
        You can usually find me drumming away or cruising around the city on two wheels when I need to unwind. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or leave a message!
