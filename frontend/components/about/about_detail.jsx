        I remember watching hacking scenes in movies as a kid thinking, "I wish I could do that". Today, I still do.

        <br/><br/>

        I took my first programming course when I was in college studying music. Needless to say, I fell in love. The fact that you can punch some letters/numbers into a text editor, compile it and watch your program come to life is mind blowing. I started building all kinds of widgets and games in my free time. Then I began building websites for friends, which led to me selling myself on Craigslist to the highest bidder as a freelance developer.

        <br/><br/>

        I realized this was something I wanted to pursue full time, so I started intensive studies, attending full-time courses to further solidify my programming skills. I had the opportunity to build and work on dozens of projects ranging across the full-stack, from modern web-apps to games and scripts that automate menial tasks.

        <br/><br/>

        Check out some of these projects by clicking on the 'PROJECTS' button in the navbar below!
