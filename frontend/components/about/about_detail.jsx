        I love programming. The fact that you can bring an idea to life by punching some letters/numbers into a computer never ceases to amaze me. I code for fun in my leisure and am always seeking opportunities for growth. I chose to pursue programming because I want to apply my skills and contribute to solving social/humanitarian/health/economic issues to help push the world forward.
