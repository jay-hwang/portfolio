        I remember watching hacking scenes in movies as a kid thinking, "I wish I could do that". Today, I still do.

        I took my first programming course when I was in college studying music. Needless to say, I fell in love. The fact that you can punch some letters/numbers into a text editor, compile it and watch your program come to life is mind blowing. I started building all kinds of widgets and games in my free time. Then I began building websites for friends, which led to me selling myself on Craigslist to the highest bidder as a freelance developer.

        <br/><br/>

        I love helping people bring their ideas to life. Shoot me a message if you have a project you want to build but don't know where to start!
