        I remember watching hacking scenes in movies as a kid wishing I could do that. Today, I still do. Only now, I know how to code. I took my first programming course when I was in college studying music.

        <br/><br/>

        Needless to say, I fell in love.

        The fact that you can punch some letters/numbers into a text editor, compile it and watch your program come to life is mind blowing. I started building all kinds of widgets and games in my free time. Then I began building websites for friends, which led to me selling myself on Craigslist to the highest bidder as a freelance developer.

        <br/><br/>

        I realized this was something I wanted to pursue full time, so I started intensive studies, attending full-time courses to solidify and formalize my programming skills. I had the opportunity to build and work on dozens of projects ranging across the full-stack, from modern web-apps to games, bots & scripts that automate menial tasks.

        <br/><br/>

        Check out some of these projects by clicking on the 'WORK' button in the navbar below
